how can one company be so consistently fucking awful at porting games to pc,abarb#3803,2018-11-26 02:09:51.114000
and still somehow fucked up the port for FF13-2,abarb#3803,2018-11-26 01:59:13.390000
and then Square Enix stole Durante's patch for FF13-2 and 13-3,abarb#3803,2018-11-26 01:58:57.764000
and then Durante patched it in 3 hours,abarb#3803,2018-11-26 01:58:39.912000
damn remember that one time FF13 came out on pc and it was a mistake and awful,abarb#3803,2018-11-26 01:58:23.333000

"The video starts with Rocco abruptly derailing the previous conversation. He then makes himself the centre of attention and tells a purposely terrible, unfunny and underwhelming “joke” about Mitt Romney, women and binders. The setup and punch-line fails wonderfully.

Derrick then joins in, going one level beyond making fun of Mitt Romney. He puts on a weird face and repeats the word “binders” in a mentally handicapped sounding voice. He’s making fun of people who care about Romney’s gaffe.

Garret starts the chaos by asking everyone to make Romney / women / binder jokes, all at the same time, everyone talking over each other.

Rocco and Derrick continue to riff off of each other, and go beyond their previous jokes by making fun of people making fun of Mitt Romney. They make fun of people’s lame, unfunny, low effort jokes about Romney, women and binders.

Brian distorts Garret’s request by facetiously saying, with unsettling conviction, that he likes to sexually bind women and have his way with them. He jokes about women and binding, but rejects joking about Romney.

Garret dismisses his own request and riffs off of Brian’s bondage jokes.

Shawn then distorts Garret’s request further, and facetiously describes Bender from Futurama. Shawn rejects joking about Romney and women, but purposely confuses “binder” and “Bender” for comedic effect.

Kevin (or Eric, I’m not sure who’s operating the camera) is frantically whipping around the camera and tries to get close-ups on as many people as he can. Unbeknownst to anyone, the quickly-changing shot causes the livestream to lag and the current frame to freeze intermittently. This adds a bonus level of Dadaist absurdism: out of focus shots, out of context close-ups, awful smears other video artifacts.

Barbara acts as a sort of audience surrogate. She sits there, says nothing, and smiles through her bewilderment.

Now remember that most of this is happening at the same time and we’re not even half-way through the clip.",abarb#3803,2018-11-24 12:08:44.875000

what's the actual website for the abc one?,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:27:27.543000
wait its flipped,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:27:22.782000
aight well fuck me,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:27:08.212000
all the questions are dumb,Catiline#0267,2018-11-07 02:27:05.940000
Question is dumb,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:22:52.216000
Higher inflation will change unemployment so that it will level out to a higher rate eventually,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:22:41.791000
,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:21:55.802000
and vice versa,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:21:22.131000
Lower unemployment means higher inflation,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:21:19.281000
These are two factors that are connected,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:20:57.352000
???,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:20:51.530000
"""Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. """,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:20:49.378000
do we still have that comparison chart with all our political affinities on it,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-11-07 02:18:41.874000
Then why not word it like that,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:18:28.393000
"""economics is not about serving anyone in particular""
that's not what it means. it's asking should economic globalisation be heavily regulated",Catiline#0267,2018-11-07 02:18:14.940000
'idk these corporations doin ok already',abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:17:57.912000
im staring at this thinking 'what like computers?',abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:17:41.439000
economics is not about serving anyone in particular,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:17:13.190000
yeah honestly,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:17:12.621000
"""If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. """,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:17:02.570000
fuck,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:16:44.364000
I immediately have a problem with the first question,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:16:43.204000
ABC is more accurate since it doesn't base it off random criteria,Catiline#0267,2018-11-07 02:16:25.899000
i'd probably say im more authoritarian than libertarian,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:15:56.916000
im doing one from the ABC now,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:15:33.664000
i just tried politicalcompass on google and clicked the first one,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:15:25.959000
I'll test,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:15:12.228000
what's the site for the test again?,Aerpub#7229,2018-11-07 02:15:08.015000
also political ideas can't be easily put on a graph,Catiline#0267,2018-11-07 02:14:12.911000
gimme like 30 and ill go authoritarian as hell,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:14:04.820000
and only like 5 about being slaves to the machine,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:13:36.698000
cos they asked like 8 questions about porn,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:13:05.021000
like if you are cool with pornography you automatically get shoved over to the left,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:12:50.898000
you need like a 3 hour long test rather than these 5 minute ones,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:12:23.560000
goddamn,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:11:29.960000
id say im kinda around the middle but ill see,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:08:01.682000

i like this a lot,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 02:02:28.404000

thats good,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 01:03:17.032000
hahahahaha,abarb#3803,2018-11-07 01:02:59.398000

except I'd wager that most people wouldn't even glance at the y axis,Spiritonia#7854,2018-11-07 00:42:54.171000
it shows that the stand your ground law was actually pretty bad,Spiritonia#7854,2018-11-07 00:42:41.328000
if you actually read this graph correctly,Spiritonia#7854,2018-11-07 00:42:28.075000
like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-11-07 00:42:22.377000
people will think bad = good,Spiritonia#7854,2018-11-07 00:42:18.051000
if we flip the graph upside down,Spiritonia#7854,2018-11-07 00:42:10.234000

"Shawn Phillip Chatfield (German: [ËˆHonnelore Philipp Chatfield], English see fn.;[1] 16 June 1984 – 30 March 2110), baptised as Shawn Phillip Chatfield,[2] was a prolific and influential composer of Sick Video Game Vids on the Internet.

 

Shawn showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent in the skill of acting like a goof (Vid Acting) in home videos filmed in his backyard, he has been directing videos from the age of eight and performed before the entire Internet since his late teens. At 18, he was working as a busser at Chilis, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always Vid Acting abundantly. While visiting Santee in 2002, he became a member of Mega64. With this, he chose to stay in Santee, where he achieved sorta fame with his friends Rocco Botte and Derrick Acosta. They have been making videos since, and have forever changed how digital humor is perceived. Mega64 was a success with the invention of youtube they lasted longer than anyone would of ever predicted. Mega64 broke new ground in the Fall of 2022 when they launched there new incarnation of the Internet (Internet 2.) Internet 2 became so popular than on the23rd of May 2032 Mega64 Inc. Bought every movie studio and became the ""Lordes of Entertainment."" Since this acquisition every movie released has completely ruled and the world has been a much happier place on a whole.  The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized. Some say he was so rad that he tansformed into energy and went into the atmostphere ( which is why, all scientist say the Ozone is totally fine now.)  He was survived by his wife Jennie, 4 Daughters and 7 Sons.",abarb#3803,2018-10-25 02:52:58.790000

"STUPID COMPUTER, STOP BEEPING!

Hold on, Tails! Learning computers is a little like learning to read! It's tough at first, but once you get it, you've got a world of information right at your fingertips!

WOOOOOOOW thats COOOOOOL!

Take your time learning to use a computer, and ask a teacher for help. Coz the more you know about computers, the more they can teach you!",abarb#3803,2018-10-10 00:24:56.621000
"Kids, there's nothing cooler than being hugged by someone ya like, but if someone tries to touch you in  a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, THAT'S NO GOOD. It's YOUR BODY. No one has the right to touch you if you don't want them to! So whaddya do? First, you say NO. Then, ya get outta there! *zoom* Most important, you gotta tell someone ya trust, like your parents, a teacher, or a police officer!",abarb#3803,2018-10-10 00:16:18.345000

the thing you posted before would work then,abarb#3803,2018-10-07 04:11:45.699000
it needs to say bachelor of business,Liam#5223,2018-10-07 04:11:28.634000

yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 02:02:01.332000
i feel so many people are doing that unit because it's the only 6 credit point one,Catiline#0267,2018-10-07 02:01:57.504000
goes to show exactly how bludge this unit is,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 02:01:54.526000
now there's only one person in our group of 6 that does them,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 02:01:47.178000
so many people didn't do them that they made them optional,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 02:01:36.673000
auto fail,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 02:01:26.415000
don't do them,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 02:01:25.254000

i need to do 2 internships to be able to graduate,Catiline#0267,2018-10-07 01:44:53.038000
true,Catiline#0267,2018-10-07 01:44:33.939000
tbf as long as you're half decent and do some work experience/internships before you graduate you're basically guaranteed a non-uni job,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:44:11.864000
budget steve jobs is an example of that,Catiline#0267,2018-10-07 01:44:02.402000
since nobody does honours,Catiline#0267,2018-10-07 01:43:09.536000

they got rid of the stupid wave asssignment,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:41:18.454000
apparently 1110 is way easier now though,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:41:08.182000
though nowhere near as hard as info1110 was,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:40:53.660000
info1113 is a tad more intense,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:40:42.985000
oh okay,Catiline#0267,2018-10-07 01:40:31.875000
so its not too programming intensive,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:40:25.323000
nah this is a data unit,Spiritonia#7854,2018-10-07 01:40:06.839000

"Autism:
When taken a character gains proficiency in all Intelligence and Wisdom based skill checks and may add double their proficiency modifier to their skills, additionally they gain advantage on these checks.
As a drawback the character receives disadvantage on all other skill checks and cannot add their proficiency bonus to any other skills. This does not apply to anything other than skills.",Liam#5223,2018-08-26 11:54:48.377000

"HOT COCOA
Makes 1 serving – scale up the quantity for additional servings

"anyway there are websites tracking how many people of what gender die, the site updates before the deaths are reported, there are weird ""rolls"" of human skin in bags at the scene of suicides",abarb#3803,2018-07-02 06:35:05.121000

we have the karma system for a reason,ana#0813,2018-06-22 13:23:21.259000
Hell even trueatheism was that before it died,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:23:12.646000
Or even fandom subreddits,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:22:58.381000
What about all r/truefilm or any other place for art,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:22:48.297000
yeah reddit isnt always bad for discussion,ana#0813,2018-06-22 13:22:40.927000

Those kinda subreddits use memes because they've got nothing fruitful to criticise about their opposing ideology,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:21:11.336000
claudio just join voice you faggot,ana#0813,2018-06-22 13:20:59.439000

I don't think he wants to increase any other taxes,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:20:44.976000
oh that's what it was before,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:20:42.058000
nah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:20:35.937000
tax cuts for his mining companies and increased tax everywhere else?,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:20:31.019000
uh,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:20:26.445000
also why is /r/socialism literally just memes,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:20:24.984000
what even is clive's beliefs?,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:20:16.762000
nah vote clive,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:20:04.376000

Workers who are not 'enlightened' are in support of the patriarchal system because they are ignorant,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:19:51.048000
vote for the sex party or something then,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:19:48.952000
what if i hate socialism and capitalism,ana#0813,2018-06-22 13:19:47.357000
what if i hate everything,ana#0813,2018-06-22 13:19:39.498000
That's not what it means,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:19:19.495000
Then there's alot of people in the 1% apparently,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:19:03.768000
That's their entire philosophy,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:19:03.632000
Anyone that isn't a socialist is a capitalist,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:18:44.065000
really?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:18:43.811000
Socialist always see the world as a power struggle and place a filler word for anyone that isn't in their camp,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 13:18:27.136000
"bourgeoise is a big word that sounds too jargony, people don't like jargon",Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:18:07.958000
sort of like how 1% is a fill in for bourgeoise,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:17:49.285000
"Ah, i think it's a fill in for bourgeoise",Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:17:41.319000
and I see it used in this context everywhere,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:17:37.489000
The capitalist here refers speifically to the boss,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:17:25.293000
You see this stuff,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:17:00.108000
,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:16:57.373000
Yet for some reason,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:16:46.236000
That's what I assumed too,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:16:41.484000
"it could legitimately just mean anyone who supports capitalism, sort of like how socialist is a term to describe someone who supports socialism",Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:16:31.519000
like,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:16:08.620000
it honestly depends on the context,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:16:07.909000
So is it just someone who makes money outside of a wage?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:14:26.344000
They're still on a wage,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:14:11.884000
a manager for a store that they don't own isn't really considered one,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:14:01.320000
like,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:13:48.715000
"uh that's a very complicated question, but depends on what kind of boss it is",Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:13:48.061000
inflation will get us there someday,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:12:48.179000
You're not wrong,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:12:41.252000
Well,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:12:38.481000
someone who makes money outside of a wage?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:12:29.154000
who is a capitalist?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:12:22.308000
refer to bosses as capitalists,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:12:11.291000
"tulips are a whole $5, one day they'll reach $1000ish",Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:12:08.102000

you should see some of the strategy games subs,Catiline#0267,2018-06-22 13:04:22.941000
Probably the best option,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 13:03:27.303000

The answer is images are bigger,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:57:24.457000

you know how imgur has gifv,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:56:23.537000
Yeah but like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:56:15.634000
like only mp4,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 05:56:08.432000
it just comes down to the compression algorithm,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:56:00.276000
lets say consistent file type,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 05:56:00.112000
gifs are usually bigger,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:55:49.990000
Alot of moving images nowdays are literally just videos,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:55:44.149000
oh the best type of answer,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 05:55:40.789000
it depends,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-22 05:55:33.967000
in file size,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 05:55:09.561000
"are videos with moving images, like FMV, bigger than videos with still images",abarb#3803,2018-06-22 05:55:00.903000

5% that australia make it out of groups,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 03:37:51.454000
good thing i didn't do architecture anyway,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:37:51.973000
nvm just consistently looks fucking depressed,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:35:16.119000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmlGIUZ7gBU,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:35:06.602000
and i was thinking of doing it as a double degree holy fuck,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:34:03.423000
hospitalised during graduation,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:33:40.113000
17 coffees,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:33:30.207000
dark rings under eyes,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:33:25.366000
enthusiasm quickly disappears,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:33:17.132000
starts off very perked up,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:33:06.905000
i saw a thing of reddit where an architecture student took a photo of herself everyday for 40 days leading up to her final project,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:32:53.178000
almost dead,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:32:16.920000
heard a story that she came home at like 2 am in the morning after like hours in the studio,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:32:11.463000
yeah yeah,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:31:46.181000
-ly difficult,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:31:42.157000
but i would have died by the end,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:31:39.932000
yeah im saying architecture is way more underrated,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:31:36.283000
if i had the atar for it i would have chosen to do it,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:31:32.866000
but architecture,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:31:22.409000
dude everybody knows about med and law,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:31:19.248000
like up there with med and law,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:31:02.749000
architecture is the most underratedly draining degree there is,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:30:49.824000
also cute af,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:30:24.834000
architecture pre tryhard anywhere,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:30:19.672000
i know some chick who's the daughter of a family friend who does architecture at uts,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:30:07.727000
its fucking awesome,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:29:18.099000
uts has the exact same mentality of gosford,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:29:13.982000
nah we just good,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:29:06.316000
damn ur guys r all tryhards,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:28:58.588000
oh i c,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:28:42.777000
this is the page i used to obtain the data,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:28:13.615000
no that is the data science page,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:28:06.363000
https://www.futurestudents.unsw.edu.au/admission-unsw,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:27:59.395000
where ur data science page,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:27:56.175000
nah i used smth else,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:27:43.796000
not here unless this is the wrong page,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:27:32.681000
https://www.futurestudents.unsw.edu.au/degreetool/science/data-science-and-decisions,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:27:24.655000
like it makes sense,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:27:23.692000
i thought this is what they would always do,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:27:21.151000
really,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:27:12.635000
they dont even do it at half of your degrees,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:27:07.132000
yeah,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:26:59.170000
so you're saying they haven't done this until recently,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:25:57.713000
yeah yeah thats new,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:25:30.213000
this is data for 2017,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:25:18.676000
well specifically for mechatronic,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:25:13.537000
when they add this,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:25:10.882000
for engineering,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:25:01.290000
yeah,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:24:59.935000
is this unsw,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:24:54.951000
,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:24:44.167000
like here,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:24:42.719000
cause as far as im concerned they usually display the range of atar cutoffs anyway,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:24:38.661000
also where did you get the news that they're changing the way cutoffs work,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:23:46.244000
so just rural schools,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:23:19.527000
"A school is included in educational disadvantage code S01C where the school is not in S01E and is:

a rural school in a town with a population of less than 10,000 people and a distance of at least 100km from the nearest centre with a population of 10,000, or

a rural school in a town with a population of less than 5,000 people and a distance between 50km and 99km from the nearest centre with a population of 10,000.",abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:23:09.117000
schools for learning or physical disabilities?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:23:03.609000
like what rural schools?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:22:50.218000
so what constitutes these kinda schools,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:22:44.850000
fuck me groupwork gonna be a pain later with these slackjawed cunts,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:22:29.998000
makes sense,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:22:02.481000
for all unis,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:22:01.793000
its an extra 10,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:21:57.787000
is the bonus pts from those schools not counted in the 5 that you normally would gain?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:21:49.379000
or went to an educational access school,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:21:22.676000
this guy must have sucked huge dick,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:21:01.559000
no its only 5 here,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:20:40.144000
so where the hell did this guy get this adjusment?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:19:53.191000
cause unsw doesnt allow more than 5 bonus pts,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:19:23.335000
unless thats the same kid that told me yesterday that xxxtentacion is still alive,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:19:21.585000
does uts even allow more than like 5,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:19:16.091000
idk how you get 13 bonus points here,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:18:55.474000
this mine,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:18:43.992000
what am i talking about,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:18:37.345000
wait,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:18:27.871000
i know now that unsw offers the cutoff w/o bonus pts,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:18:23.588000
now that's weird,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:18:08.447000
so i guess it counts bonus points,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:17:55.317000
in my degree,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:17:45.700000
cos im friends with people that got <89,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:17:39.967000
Median cutoff?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:17:19.581000
actually wait maybe not,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:17:19.110000
So wait wth were they showing us before?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:17:13.440000
Okay i got it,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:16:54.426000
the bonus points would make it easier to get in,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:16:54.403000
"it shows the lowest atar to get an offer, that atar wouldnt include bonus points",abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:16:40.205000
So will unis who offer bonus pts still present atar cutoff without bonus pts?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:16:04.157000
the cool thing tho now is that my degree is now harder to get into than law,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:15:31.534000
Interesting,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:15:23.765000
yeah itll probably happen later for yall cos ur unis are scared of losing face,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:14:55.696000
Imma check unsw engineering now,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:14:40.037000
Whoa really,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-22 00:14:30.898000
idk how but mine went up,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:09:05.901000
except for one thing,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:08:59.738000
business was 90 here before now its 70.3,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:08:36.796000
so now atar requirements for all unis soon are gonna be real fuckin low,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:05:28.690000
,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:05:08.355000
everyone getting mad at uts now cos one of the law double degrees is now technically an 84,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:04:01.770000
government says you have to display the actual lowest atar entry for a subject,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:03:25.333000
damn they changing the way atar cutoffs work,abarb#3803,2018-06-22 00:03:02.703000
Y,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-06-21 20:01:49.054000

double the cost/episode,abarb#3803,2018-06-21 14:10:31.706000
couldnt find it there but for some reason Sanity had it,abarb#3803,2018-06-21 14:09:33.250000
the rurouni kenshin full box set was $200,abarb#3803,2018-06-21 14:06:33.448000

nup,abarb#3803,2018-06-21 14:06:00.988000

jesus $50,ana#0813,2018-06-21 14:05:22.919000
what is the point,abarb#3803,2018-06-21 14:02:18.415000
this is just full seasons of fucking anime,abarb#3803,2018-06-21 14:01:21.292000
i think nekopara had an animated ova ages ago though,ana#0813,2018-06-21 14:01:08.964000

so we're just burning through stored up eu atm,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 07:56:11.874000
and the nether stuff needs time to spool up,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 07:56:00.278000

the furnances,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:41:40.241000

Yeah sure,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:41:34.528000
And sort out the ones that can't be macerated,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:41:25.460000
That's what I meant,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:41:09.290000
I was going to make a system that takes the ores from the mkner and automatically macerates them,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:41:04.876000
I just move the stuff from one chest to the macerators,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:41:00.319000

that seems pretty useful,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:39:43.728000

I don't have to go on collection runs every 10 minutes,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:38:12.324000
The miner gives us so much emc,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:37:56.740000

ngl guys i got no idea what yall are on about but this next level shit,abarb#3803,2018-06-19 06:36:21.987000
Miner + emc basically means you win the game,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:36:12.559000
also the emc,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:35:55.598000
it means things happen very quickly,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:35:30.995000
its mostly just how goddamn good the advanced miner is,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:35:25.989000
I played for another hour or 2 last nihgt,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:35:09.826000
how much time have you spent,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:34:52.032000
But there's some other stuff that needs setting up,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:34:44.759000
I've done that,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:34:36.259000
I can set up an automated macerator/smelting thing if you want,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:34:28.797000
Oh wow,Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:34:12.570000
"wtf I keep getting emails about people going ""oh can I make ur website for you""",Catiline#0267,2018-06-19 06:34:01.463000
We can now process a stack of ores in about 20 seconds,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:33:58.127000
attempting to overclock them as far as possible,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:33:45.458000
I may or may not have blown up a few rotary macerators,Spiritonia#7854,2018-06-19 06:33:34.801000

Event Cinemas: hmm uhhhhh WACKY ACE VENTURA GIF IN WHICH HE GIVES FINGER GUNS TO THE CAMERA AND PULLS OFF A WWWWWACKY FACE


""stop it""


Ace Ventura's face grows more and more wacky. 𝘶𝘯𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘺 wacky. before long, Ace Ventura has bypassed the physical capabilities possessed by famous actor Jim Carrey and has transcended all known philosophical levels of wackiness, of which there are 4; i will not explain. Ace Ventura begins to seemingly burst out of the viewing device... 


and then he does. but only to the neck. 


his now sweaty, pulsating, malformed face is at this point physically stuck between realms of 2d and 3d - technology and reality. at some point, the now physical manifestation of corporate subterfuge has begun to experience pain. it shrieks, unblinking.


""no please no more i cannot STAND it""


the shrieking continues. His lungs remain in the technological environment. He can continue. On and on the shrieking continues. The shrieks lower in pitch at seemingly random intervals, before returning to their uncomfortably high tone. his eyes remain open. his features begin to rearrange. it is disgusting.

“oh it is GROSS oh gosh oh no!”

One of ace ventura’s front teeth slide out. It is a USB. An 8 gigabyte USB. Perhaps molars are 16gb? Upon investigation, ace ventura cleaves a finger clean off. It hurts. Oh it hurts.

“yowch!” they are not going to believe this at the emergency room.

There are no files on the USB.

ngl dark souls will take you fucking forever to finish if you dont have a general idea of where to go,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:41:53.596000

"in berseria at least, ng+ you run away from every normal enemy and only fight bosses cos its faster",abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:38:05.808000
vesperia early game kinda rough on normal and then ng+ is where you play the entire game on Insane underlevelled and stomp,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:37:09.666000
same with tales games,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:36:35.866000

"boi ""dark souls is hard""",ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:36:14.021000
boss has 17k health on normal which sounds like a lot but its not so you can end up accidentally killing him a lot which just fucking sucks man holy shit so draining,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:35:53.357000
none of the issues people complain about wiht ds1,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:35:15.577000
i reckon ds3 has like,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:35:04.823000
you have to somehow lure this fucking retarded boss into the circumference of the battlefield and then he actually has to stop moving which NEVER happens and THEN the billybally plant has to sorta just GO and do its thing,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:35:03.631000

i still remember this one,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:33:22.651000
SECRET MISSION 3: stun Gattuso with billybally plants,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:33:17.644000
and it autosaves constantly so lmao no quitting,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:33:14.959000
yeah dark souls just counts all your play time,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:33:02.251000
ah ok,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:32:56.723000
because 8 hours was dying to bosses cos their secret missions were stupid,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:32:53.476000
wait what,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:32:39.611000
i'd racked up 20 hours on an 12 hour save file at one point,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:32:23.712000
i reckon versperia is incredibly structurally sound but the secret missions are dark souls hard,abarb#3803,2018-06-15 08:31:48.024000
then ive spend like 20-40 hours in the others,ana#0813,2018-06-15 08:31:39.272000

what the fuck i dont know how to read this shit,ana#0813,2018-05-13 12:26:17.460000
it means that those people need some lessons in how to not rape people,Spiritonia#7854,2018-05-13 12:26:15.270000

"not ""yes I would rape somebody""",Spiritonia#7854,2018-05-13 12:20:24.382000
because the men specifically said it isn't rape,Spiritonia#7854,2018-05-13 12:20:10.856000
but the headline is in direct contradiction,Spiritonia#7854,2018-05-13 12:19:51.068000
shockingly so,Spiritonia#7854,2018-05-13 12:19:32.976000
hence still a bad statistic,Spiritonia#7854,2018-05-13 12:19:29.237000

So I guess that's where I would be if I cared,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:21:27.598000
"As much as that's apparently where I am, I really don't care that much in the whole scheme of things",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:21:13.974000
oh boy,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:20:36.908000
,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:20:35.498000
Big rip for britian,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:17:53.356000
England is just very restrictive,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:17:51.141000
It's happening here too,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:17:33.760000
Depending on what you consider civil liberties,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:17:26.212000
"If you live in England, this is a big strongly agree",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:14:55.326000
"""Our civil liberties are being excessively curbed in the name of counter-terrorism.""",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:14:45.195000
It's just relogion,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:13:38.526000
The last 2 are ez af,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:13:29.968000
I'm on like page 3,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:13:15.332000
Not even close,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:13:12.391000
You finished the quiz yet?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:13:06.553000
I understand,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:12:39.020000
Yes greentexting was necessary,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:12:33.373000

Like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:11:55.182000
Pain is literally just a negative reinforcement tool for you,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:11:53.622000
Well yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:11:36.141000
Just use it to teach karma I guess,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:11:10.706000
I think it's fine to do if you don't actually harm the child,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:10:06.926000
and not really much effort,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:10:00.140000
doesnt require coming up with anything creative,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:09:56.106000
easy,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:09:41.569000
but yeah,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:09:41.053000
I realise this too,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:09:38.417000
like there may just be an alternative that works just as well or better,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:09:34.564000
i mean its hard to know for sure if any form of punishment is necessary,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:09:22.063000
It's like the shortcut,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:08:44.661000
Just that for some children it is necessary,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:08:34.007000
"But imo, not immoral",Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:08:31.911000
It's not necessary,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:08:24.407000
Yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:08:21.595000
I don't think it's a catchall thing for all children,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:08:17.475000
there are other forms of punishment of course,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:08:16.038000
i mean id say that spanking isnt a necessary part of disciplining a child,ana#0813,2018-04-23 10:07:58.497000
That's what all punishments are,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:07:44.226000
Well,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:07:36.970000
I realise it's basically just conditioning,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:06:52.518000
Yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:06:33.792000
It's all about when and why,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:06:09.244000
"Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily have to do with spanking",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:06:00.603000
"And not necessarily, you could think your parents are bad parents",Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:05:13.212000
I think we can agree to disagree on that above question,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:04:54.297000
Based on how I was brought up this is objectively true,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:04:17.589000
"""Good parents sometimes have to spank their children.""",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:04:06.830000
off*,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:02:34.496000
It just needs to be run well enough to avoid pissing people odd,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:02:33.038000
"Like, I'm not saying a 1 party system is inherently bad",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:02:15.406000
Revolution is objectively worse than a democratic system,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:01:35.332000
Uhhhhhh revolution is a voice,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:01:22.100000
"Uhhhhhh, the people have a voice",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 10:01:14.432000
Hence no arguments,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:00:55.971000
Noone else has a voice,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:00:49.239000
In a one party system,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:00:44.585000
Eh,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 10:00:39.359000
"And if the conditions are bad enough, it could be worse than a democratic system",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:57:26.133000
My point was more that it's not 100% in avoiding arguments,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:56:57.804000
Just that it happens faster,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:56:21.238000
It's not saying the change is a good thing,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:56:16.588000
Nah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:55:58.336000
Needs more information,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:55:14.171000
But it could also incite revolution,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:55:10.958000
Well yeah,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:55:04.960000
Is an objective fact,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:54:42.932000
This one,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:54:38.031000
,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:54:32.792000
I need a neutral option for this one,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:54:19.493000
Yeah but what if you think about it both ways?,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:53:54.572000
There's a more retarded one,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:53:52.034000
Also,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:53:47.708000
Controlling unemployment means you think about things in a employee centric manner,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:53:33.421000
Controlling inflation means you think about things in a buisness centric manner,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:53:11.590000
And makes the statement retarded,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:52:58.281000
This is still proving my point that they're as important as each other,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:52:53.530000
Basically,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:52:43.536000
No unemployment causes hyperinflation,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:52:25.851000
Literally year 11 eco,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:52:22.280000
Ik,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:52:19.041000
You wanna prevent large amounts of either,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:52:18.409000
A little bit of unemployment is a good thing for the economy,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:52:13.728000
You don't want to prevent either,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:52:00.627000
"But if you control one, you can prevent the other",Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:51:51.979000
For economics to work they both need to exist,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:51:50.130000
Yeah ik,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:51:42.589000
That's why they're both important,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:51:38.484000
Arguably they cause each other,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:51:33.476000
Exactly,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:51:31.378000
One causes the other,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:51:21.035000
Nah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-04-23 09:51:16.853000
They're both just as important as each other,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:51:11.551000
Fuckin retarded,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-23 09:51:00.292000

noice,ana#0813,2018-04-10 11:20:33.170000
Which is great,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:18:08.756000
150 per heading leaves me at 2250 words,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:18:05.524000
So like 150 words per heading should be fine,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:17:14.827000
There's like 15 actual headings I need to fill with those words those,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:17:01.964000
well then you simply dont provide a reference i think,ana#0813,2018-04-10 11:16:27.709000
"oh, overall I need 1500-2500",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:16:27.635000

"Like could I just say ""This is an idea I thought of myself""?",Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:16:17.994000
Side note: can I use my brain as a reference?,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:15:44.970000
And what the reference was,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:15:27.149000
I like doing it as I go because then I don't forget where I need to,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:15:11.992000
My only issue is making sure I know where to reference,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:15:00.956000
Could probably write that in like 5min,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:14:52.012000
Not too bad,Aerpub#7229,2018-04-10 11:14:36.469000

From the few lectures ive been to about social psychology ive come to the conclusion that to impose the label of gender binarism (or non binarism) on the subject of attraction is not conducive to good discussion,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-04-09 01:26:54.415000

There is not a strict correlation?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-04-09 01:23:38.140000
Or why studies have found that there is not a strict correlation between romantic orientation and sexual orientation,Catiline#0267,2018-04-09 01:22:38.949000
it doesn't really count for the variety within bisexuality or topics such as monogamy vs polyamory,Catiline#0267,2018-04-09 01:22:05.852000

is to look at a government,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-28 04:27:05.026000
the only proof of that you need,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-28 04:27:01.292000
And the free market is natural progression of human society,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-28 04:26:56.850000
Because i think that the privitisation has its merits,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-28 04:26:41.590000

huh there's an economics blog for valve,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:14:39.750000
oh true,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:10:08.452000
through steam,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:08:43.462000
not to mention they also sell alot of games,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:08:40.385000
cs:go and tf2 only exist because of skins,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:08:24.039000
true,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:08:23.623000
12 years running,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:08:17.256000
which is why tf2's economy still works even though it's been like,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:08:13.229000
valve also runs multiple actual economies,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:08:09.654000
ex-government economists running their stuff,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:07:54.716000
valve has like,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:07:48.966000
to figure it out,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:05:55.471000
it doesn't take a genius,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:05:45.675000
that said,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:05:37.060000
it wouldn't suprise me,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:05:35.068000
I mean,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:05:31.815000
i wonder if rockstar has dedicated economists like valve,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:04:58.194000
and then the expensive stuff sort of became the standard after that,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:04:36.958000
there was a lot of money hacks so they had a few money sinks (yachts etc),Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:04:10.914000
depends,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:03:53.835000
probably caused the inflation intentionally,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:03:42.819000
well,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:03:28.240000
probably intentionally,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:03:21.157000
yeah they never adjusted the shark card prices to inflation,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:03:11.035000
$100usd for 2 nice cars?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:03:10.978000
especially when you consider shark card prices,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:02:58.765000
but now its just become insane,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:02:48.778000
I enjoy it even,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:02:44.779000
I don't mind the game having a grind to it,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:02:33.920000
+ an extra few hundred thousand for the mods,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:02:05.442000
$4mil for the high end stuff,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:01:54.459000
$2-3mil for the nice cars,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:01:37.312000
now its like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:01:17.493000
so getting that $400k from pac standard was alot,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:01:15.881000
yeah and you got 10 million if you completed it properly,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 11:01:09.442000
that was the zenturno\,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:59.298000
$750k,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:46.970000
and the most expensive car was like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:43.822000
but nothing over $2k,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:37.252000
maybe a bit more,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:33.067000
$500-1000,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:29.599000
"keep in mind beforehand, the most expensive clothing articles were like",Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:24.631000
and challenging to an extent,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:11.453000
they were fun,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:05.606000
but yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 11:00:03.689000
iirc,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:59:56.615000
it was the first or second major dlc,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:59:55.579000
the new heists are basically 'try out our new purchasable items',Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:59:53.010000
but that's true i guess,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:59:44.188000
i mean didn't they get released a year and a half after the launch?,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:59:10.059000
that was also before rockstar realised exactly how much money they could get out of gta:o,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:58:50.206000
yeah they were,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:58:31.770000
the original heists were okay though,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:58:21.761000
true,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:52:05.975000
albeit it does become more of a chore,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:51:55.150000
that volotol mission was just as boring the first time as it was the last,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:51:43.344000
why would you want people to actually enjoy playing your game,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:51:15.822000
they're only bad if you do them 500 times,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:51:14.143000
That's too much effort,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-21 10:51:13.790000
more god awful heists,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:50:55.756000
what else do you expect them to add when making cars is the best profit:effort ratio for them?,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-21 10:50:41.180000
and maybe a few new special races,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:50:22.787000
some adversary modes too,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:50:15.016000
yeah I know,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:49:57.780000
apparently the update was only cars,Catiline#0267,2018-03-21 10:49:48.079000
can't wait for some more mediocre vehicles,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 10:44:43.230000

as in a fighting game joystickl,Liam#5223,2018-03-21 08:22:57.746000
I feel they are too slow,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-21 07:47:44.411000
but on Getting Over It,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-21 07:47:39.758000
according to people that play overwatch on console max joystick sens is good,ana#0813,2018-03-21 07:45:02.787000
Joysticks are too slow,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-21 07:40:37.187000
I would have to disagree there,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-21 07:40:32.949000
according to AJ,Liam#5223,2018-03-21 07:40:22.083000
apparently,Liam#5223,2018-03-21 07:40:14.447000
which makes it laughably easy,Liam#5223,2018-03-21 07:40:11.426000
cause you can use joysticks,Liam#5223,2018-03-21 07:40:00.505000
the game is also very easy,Liam#5223,2018-03-21 07:39:50.402000
I haven't played it with or without bad controls,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 06:13:47.784000
That said,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 06:13:40.734000
It'd be boring as fuck,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 06:13:24.517000
If the controls worked,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 06:13:18.673000

Nah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-21 06:07:54.686000

what is this?,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-20 10:30:32.497000
Our 1-year anniversary was supposed to be 2 weeks ago.,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:30:13.546000
"We broke each other’s hearts. I told all my friends I had gotten over you days after we broke up, but I longed for you to come back and maybe tell me you had messed up, but you never did. I messed up too and I wasn’t scared to admit that. I would’ve liked to tell you this in person but just the thought of it makes me so nervous – what would I do if you didn’t like what I said?",Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:30:08.445000
"I’m sorry for all the hardship I put you through with my problems. Maybe it wasn’t right for me to weigh you down with all my sadness, but I thought maybe you could’ve helped me out a bit more. In the end, however, you wouldn’t agree to make a compromise. I gave you all I had, even if it was little, but you didn’t accept anything. All I wanted was just to spend the little time we got together with you.",Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:30:03.691000
"But you were always so sad – scared that we weren’t going to work out because of our busy lives and restrictions. I tried so hard to make you happy with what I could offer, but it was so hard for you to accept. You would always send me photos of you crying, and I didn’t want to give up on us. I wanted to make us both happy, but it hurt me so much to see you so sad. I fell into a deep spiral of depression, threatening to kill myself whenever I couldn’t take it anymore. And of course you tried to help me – but that made it worse for you. We were fighting a losing battle.",Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:29:57.506000
"Everything became a blur of feelings and emotions and next thing I know you asked me out and we started dating. Our relationship wasn’t stable, but I loved you so much. You made me happy when you weren’t sad, you bought me so much food, you worried about me and made me feel useful when I wanted to end it all. We had so much fun during our happy times together. My favourite memory of us together was walking around the park and talking about feelings and you comforting me when I couldn’t stop crying about my self-doubt.",Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:29:51.831000
And then we talked. We talked a lot. We became each other’s best friends – someone that we would rant to about anything and everything and we would talk late into the night helping each other out. We would always want to meet up. That made me so happy and I know it made you happy too.,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:29:47.435000
"We met at a party. I’ll admit it was pretty brave of me to come up to you and start talking. You were so nice to me. You listened to every word I had to say and I tried to reciprocate that too. But we were still strangers then, only knowing each other’s names.",Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-20 10:29:43.877000

or course notes?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 02:01:03.631000
do they not understand the concept of online recordings?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 02:00:58.380000
yeah,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 02:00:51.621000
so i have a day where I travel 2 hours there and 2 hours back for a single 1hr lecture,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 02:00:50.078000
you go to usyd right?,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 02:00:35.194000
Because they are cunts,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 02:00:23.845000
y,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 02:00:15.270000
wtf,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 02:00:12.918000
Unless you are in my fucking faculty and attendance gets marked inlectures,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 02:00:06.107000
like on wednesday i walked into a marketing lecture and stayed there for an hour,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 02:00:05.902000
all mine have had 400-500 people,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 02:00:02.963000
what kind of lecture has 20 people?,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:59:49.751000
there is no roll marking or anything,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:59:44.654000
lol,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:59:39.961000
who gives,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:59:36.215000
and theyre like wtf you dont belong,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:59:27.275000
what,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:59:24.746000
what if you walk into a lecture with like 20 people,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:59:23.166000
id go to random lectures but idk whats what,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:59:16.333000
cause i just go to the lectures and learn shit,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:58:56.605000
i honestly don't give a fuck,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:58:51.554000
well at least for the first 6 hours 1 hour = 1%,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:58:23.534000
but to finish all the experiments is to get 8% of your total mark,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:57:56.491000
my god my timetable keeps fetching week 3 not week 4,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:57:33.920000
why do you need >100%,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:57:07.150000
well not to any sort of actual meaningful end,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:57:00.759000
also you cant get over 100% if thats where youre going,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:56:37.181000
i meant 6% of total mark,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:56:34.573000
that's what i meant,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:56:19.307000
fuck,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:56:17.297000
not marks,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:56:15.278000
units of credit are how you measure courses....,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:56:13.234000
and do all the experiments,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:56:12.498000
so if you somehow get all your tutes and tests 100%,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:56:05.926000
er,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:56:02.510000
to finish all the expts you get 8 units of credit total,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:55:54.741000
fuck its gay,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:55:41.264000
at lesat youre not doing physics,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:55:39.713000
and yes you have to participate in a number of experiments to gain 6 compulsory units of credits,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:55:35.304000
"Hey, at least you don't have to interview a real fucking person to make a documentary that will then be played on a massive ass boat in Darling Harbour",ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:55:11.277000
i don't do psychology but i go to all of the lectures so im practically a psych student,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:55:02.872000
also if u dont complete 6 you fail,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:54:42.657000
and you can do 10 for bonus points,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:54:36.653000
6 hours,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:54:07.338000
its pretty disgusting,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:54:04.278000
tell me if you have to participate in research,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:53:57.188000
I'll jump on when I finish updating,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:53:31.946000
okie,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:53:16.788000
yeah i can deal with low quality mics,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:51:46.489000
mics are whatever,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:50:52.787000
I probs will as an elective,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:50:41.365000
does anyone else do any psychology?,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:47:57.151000
Also group vote in terms of whether I get onto voice with a slightly fucked mic or stay off discord,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:46:53.926000
so probably,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:46:02.508000
I'm updating fortnite atm,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:46:00.124000
"i'm having lunch soon, maybe after",Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:43:59.647000
no ur mum ghey hahaaaaa,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:43:21.550000
@everyone video games?,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:43:04.710000
its almost like youre trying to use as much bandwidth as possible 🤔,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:42:53.306000
it fucks up an isp if a bunch of people use speedtests around the same time,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:42:33.040000
that is a problem though,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:42:06.029000
reminds me of the time an isp guy was complaining about people using speedtests on reddit,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:41:32.464000
its hosted by netflix so its the speed youll get if you're watchign netflix,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:40:52.268000
use fast.com,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:40:34.373000
that's why it seems faster,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:40:29.447000
speedtest gets priority over other websites,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:40:17.693000
ipt still not relevant,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:40:07.010000
it still shouldn't put a dent in the bandwidth that nodes have,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:40:06.139000
uh,Liam#5223,2018-03-18 01:40:03.610000
stfu ben coles isnt ruining your internet,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:39:53.591000
depends if they've got a centralised or distributed system,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:39:34.909000
wtf,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:39:32.013000
"they've also got security cameras, idk if it's kept in the store",Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:39:16.766000
and significantly less,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:39:06.059000
that'd be about video game amounts of data,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:39:01.836000
no idea why tbh,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:39:00.702000
even then,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:38:52.276000
oh man i wonder why my internet is so slow,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:38:45.835000
depends if they backup their sales live,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:38:43.402000
I doubt coles would use much tbh,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:38:27.870000
Depends if they bought fttp or not,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:38:07.575000
Coles is probably taking up a lot though,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:37:51.894000
It only included like 3 shops in West street,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:37:32.326000
Nah there was a website ages ago that allowed you to see the node and what was connected to it,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:37:19.883000
is also connected to them,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:36:53.047000
I mean the node,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:36:49.755000
who aren't just old people,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:36:33.409000
Nah it goes directly from Coles down my road,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:36:33.211000
"in that case, you're probably also connected with the people on the other side of west street",Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:36:17.314000
of okay,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:36:05.085000
It's near coles,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:36:01.670000
across on the other side of west street,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:36:01.173000
if its like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:35:56.062000
depending on where your node is though,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:35:54.407000
yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:35:49.156000
since we have a bunch of weekend houses on my street,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:35:35.243000
we have old people too but on weekends a bunch of people come down from the city,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:35:26.628000
we get good bandwidth all the time,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:35:12.663000
so like,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:35:05.787000
since we rarely get 50/20,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:35:05.021000
I live in an old people area though,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:35:04.478000
we were going to upgrade but we'd never reach 100/40,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:35:01.427000
same,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:34:59.922000
oh yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:34:59.420000
50/20,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:34:50.718000
don't you have 100/40?,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:34:47.254000
it was a rainy day so everyone was probably on netflix,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:34:46.731000
due to the amazing fibre to the node,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:34:35.782000
i've dropped down to 10mb/s before though with speedtest,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:34:17.078000
I entirely forgot I opened it,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:34:09.188000
In my defense,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:34:03.590000
don't install things while speedtesting,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:33:55.358000
yeah,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:33:49.398000
this might explain it,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:32:06.625000
,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:32:05.673000
wait,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:31:53.308000
wait,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:31:52.725000
wait,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:31:51.576000
I think everything is high right now,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:31:45.500000
its better than using the ookla speedtest,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:31:23.966000
hell test your internet on a 4k video on youtube,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:31:08.801000
use like anything else,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:30:55.417000
speedtest is 100% fucked,ana#0813,2018-03-18 01:30:50.587000
,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:30:45.962000
I think speedtest is just fucked,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:30:36.871000
while true,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:30:29.984000
take back everything I said,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:30:28.427000
yeah it's weird,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:29:43.550000
not sure about your thingo here though,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:28:12.451000
that should explain the speedtest result,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:28:08.236000
,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:27:51.950000
the browser then continuously starts trying to download bigger and bigger amounts of data,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:27:44.668000
,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:27:41.361000
4 bits,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:27:20.653000
they start off by downloading at incredibly low bandwidths,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:27:18.362000
how downloads work,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:27:07.954000
buit,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:27:04.243000
I'm not sure if this is the case iny our situation ben,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:27:03.204000
It's pretty consistent for me,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:26:58.469000
nah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-18 01:26:54.841000
idk,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:26:47.525000
shady as,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:26:26.903000
for the few seconds of the speedtest it stays at 20 but then it doubles afterward,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:26:19.558000
but whenever i try speedtest.net it's double it,Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:25:41.634000
"it's funny, whenever i test it on google i get 20mb/s download",Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:25:30.422000
a n g e r y,Onetonsoup#4446,2018-03-18 01:23:50.452000
I guess I don't have much to complain about,ana_sthetic#1114,2018-03-18 01:23:03.275000
"only took two weeks, nice",Catiline#0267,2018-03-18 01:00:26.010000

Better go tilted till I get one,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-17 00:40:52.231000
The trap elim is going to be stupid,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-17 00:40:44.366000

Still retarded,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-04 08:33:33.274000
my point was just that its legal for insurance companies to charge women less,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:33:16.339000
I know,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:33:01.646000
Seeing as since I crashed my car once the premium went up,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-04 08:32:10.756000
I was aware of how insurance works,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-04 08:31:58.553000
Okay,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-04 08:31:42.238000
same way its cheaper to park it in a driveway rather than curbside,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:31:31.890000
because its less likely to get robbed or scratched,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:31:16.558000
It does,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:31:07.008000
But okay,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-04 08:30:55.093000

Steam gets away with price gouging because it's hardly regulated between countries,Aerpub#7229,2018-03-04 08:30:26.197000
that can include areas,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:30:20.841000
and then adjusts the price based on that,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:30:13.856000
is they basically take the risk that you're going to cause an accident based on statistics of your demographic,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:30:08.260000
How insurance works,Spiritonia#7854,2018-03-04 08:29:46.903000

"people make fun of all those 'HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU???'-type infomercials but goddamn it this is serious and it happens whenever i eat pizza

what do you if the tap is knob-based and you got pizza grease on your fingertips? there's no elbow action going on here. i tried 'soap on fingers sink knob' to try and make google think my problem was relatable and that just gave me pictures of taps.

so i caved in and typed the primate-like 'pizza grease fingers sink knob'. i felt disgusting. that search and that search alone felt so degenerate and there was nothing i could do about it. this presented me with several results about 'how to fix a faucet' AS IF it was just the taps fault for being like that. i thought yknow ""maybe google had a very alternative political stance on this"", so i typed in 'gay son fingers sink knob' and ALMOST hit enter but i realised what i typed and hit backspace a lot instead

Could you imagine,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-29 00:00:45.104000
But,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-29 00:00:41.339000
Yeah,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-29 00:00:39.279000

which is what politicians think underage kids drink,Liam#5223,2018-01-29 00:00:23.721000

"its jsut ""alcopops""",Liam#5223,2018-01-29 00:00:12.041000
most alcohol is staying the same price,Liam#5223,2018-01-29 00:00:06.458000
At $28,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-29 00:00:05.452000
Of vodka,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-29 00:00:00.081000

they make a lot of wine,Catiline#0267,2018-01-28 23:59:41.373000
People wouldnt stop buying wine,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:59:40.644000

https://i.imgur.com/ys0wbFF.png,Catiline#0267,2018-01-28 23:59:14.178000

south australia would just collapse if people stopped buying wine,Catiline#0267,2018-01-28 23:58:00.722000
"Well, the point of it is to counteract binge drinking",Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:57:59.679000
Goon will simply die,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:57:44.915000
minimum cost laws would probably give exceptions to wine,Catiline#0267,2018-01-28 23:57:44.090000
$1.5 per standard,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:57:38.124000
Minimum cost laws,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:57:32.454000
Until,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:57:28.586000
that's why you can get bottles of wine for $8,Catiline#0267,2018-01-28 23:57:22.060000
you didnt say that its on the actual alcohol,ana#0813,2018-01-28 23:57:12.470000
wine is also super subsidised which is why it's so cheap,Catiline#0267,2018-01-28 23:57:11.879000
82.76 * .37 = $30,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:57:03.845000
right,ana#0813,2018-01-28 23:57:01.752000
1 litre of vodka has .37 litres of alcohol in it,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:56:42.844000
Alcohol is taxed at $82.76 a litre,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:56:24.987000
Vodka is 37% alcohol,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:55:59.700000
You could get a lite of vodka,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:55:50.650000
i think you have a $ instead of % somewhere?,ana#0813,2018-01-28 23:55:44.534000
uhhh,ana#0813,2018-01-28 23:55:36.580000
If the government decided to remove those taxes,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:55:35.784000
So basically,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:55:27.034000
$30 is going to taxes,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:55:19.637000
Price at $50,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:55:05.051000
In a 1 liter bottle of vodka,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:54:57.553000
Which means,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:54:50.143000
Taxes are at $82.76 per litre,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:54:47.922000
Excluding brandy,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:54:25.176000
Or spirits,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-28 23:54:22.295000

be careful with your investment 🤔,ana#0813,2018-01-25 12:37:07.233000
likely stopping somewhere between 6 or 7 since this is where most people place others,ana#0813,2018-01-25 12:36:51.831000
so its far more likely for his score to go down marginally,ana#0813,2018-01-25 12:36:32.782000
"giving someone an 8, 9 or 10 means theyre exceptional",ana#0813,2018-01-25 12:36:19.817000
you see people are unlikely to vote above 7,ana#0813,2018-01-25 12:36:05.951000
no no no it only goes down from here,ana#0813,2018-01-25 12:35:53.361000

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhL2OWXZ26s,Liam#5223,2018-01-24 03:30:59.951000
they lose alot of money,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:23:07.406000
and all of their stocks go down,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:23:02.868000
so if they go down a shittonne,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:58.175000
the stocks are in the brokers name,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:53.009000
from my redbubble,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:11.459000
another item,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:09.080000
just bought,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:05.990000
who the fuck,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:04.858000
okay,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:22:02.481000
but it's in their name,Catiline#0267,2018-01-24 03:21:53.200000
you also have to hope your broker doesn't go broke,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:21:29.282000
well,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:21:19.880000
so wait until a global financial crisis,Catiline#0267,2018-01-24 03:21:09.049000
oh ok,Catiline#0267,2018-01-24 03:21:04.862000
that's why they're risky as shit,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:49.224000
you have to pay the $10000 that it went up by,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:43.421000
so if it goes up to $200,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:30.472000
you're liable to pay the amount that it goes up by,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:23.138000
if the stock goes up,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:13.727000
however,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:10.554000
-$500 paid to borrow,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:07.859000
$5000,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:20:02.537000
and get the difference,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:19:53.321000
you then sell the borrowed stock,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:19:24.710000
stock goes down to $50,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:19:10.910000
anyways,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:19:00.561000
except you don't actually own the stock,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:18:57.210000
for $10000 worth of stock,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:18:51.995000
so you pay $500,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:18:36.798000
You borrow 100 of the share for 5% of the value,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:18:10.062000
you predict it to drop to $50,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:17:52.913000
share x is valued at $100,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:17:44.097000
for example,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:17:31.639000
the reason they're risky is because you only pay a small % of the total cost of the share you're borrowing,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:17:28.746000
"except because they're borrowed, you don't end up with the shares, you end up with the value that was lost on the actual stock",Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:17:03.597000
"you borrow shares to sell, then buy them back at a lower price",Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:16:30.752000
essentially,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:15:55.355000
stocks going further down is a profit if you're trading in cfds,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:15:51.361000
that's good actually,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:15:36.286000
because the stocks could keep going down,Catiline#0267,2018-01-24 03:15:28.366000
they're risky as shit howevere,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:15:17.970000
a way to profit from stocks (or coins) going down,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:15:12.483000
basically,Spiritonia#7854,2018-01-24 03:15:00.232000
nope,Catiline#0267,2018-01-24 03:14:11.055000

COMP1511 is an intensive introduction to programming and computing, designed for

students enrolled in a CSE major (BioInf, CompSci, CompEng, SoftwareEng)
Mechatronics majors

COMP1511 is not compulsory for any other Engineering degrees.

You should check the program description for your program in the UNSW Handbook before deciding to enrol (or stay enrolled) in COMP1511.

"What a friend we have in Jesus, 
all our sins and griefs to bear! 
What a privilege to carry 
everything to God in prayer! 
O what peace we often forfeit, 
O what needless pain we bear, 
all because we do not carry 
everything to God in prayer. 

Have we trials and temptations? 
Is there trouble anywhere? 
We should never be discouraged; 
take it to the Lord in prayer. 
Can we find a friend so faithful 
who will all our sorrows share? 
Jesus knows our every weakness; 
take it to the Lord in prayer. 

Are we weak and heavy laden, 
cumbered with a load of care? 
Precious Savior, still our refuge; 
take it to the Lord in prayer. 
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? 
Take it to the Lord in prayer! 
In his arms he'll take and shield thee; 
thou wilt find a solace there.",ana#0813,2017-11-26 13:07:32.028000
